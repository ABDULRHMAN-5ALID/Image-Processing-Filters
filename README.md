# Image Processing - Filtering Techniques 🚀

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates various **image filtering techniques** using Python, OpenCV, and NumPy. The main goal is to apply different filters to modify images, including:

- ✅ **Smoothing (Box Filter)** – Reduces noise and smooths the image.
- ✅ **Edge Detection (Sobel Filter)** – Highlights strong transitions in pixel intensity.
- ✅ **Sharpening Filter** – Enhances image details and contrast.

## 🔹 Technologies Used
- Python 🐍
- OpenCV 📷
- NumPy 🔢
- Matplotlib 📊

## 📸 Sample Results
Here are examples of the filtered images:

| Original | Smoothed | Edge Detection (Sobel X) | Sharpened |
|----------|----------|-------------------------|-----------|
| ![Original](original.jpg) | ![Smoothed](smoothed.jpg) | ![Edges](edges_x.jpg) | ![Sharpened](sharpened.jpg) |

## 🛠 How to Run the Code
1. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib
   
Open Image_Processing_Filtering.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or Google Collab.
Run the notebook to process and visualize filtered images.
